        ## [We are the world's first scalable civic platform.](#scalable)

        Compared with social and consumer technology, civic technology is disparate, out-of-date, unsustainable or dominated by legacy solutions. Civically is a modern web platform comparable to the biggest social and consumer platforms, but built in the spirit of the civic sector.

        * Any government, big or small, can provide industry-leading online services cheaply and efficiently.

        * Online legal services, particularly services that expand the legal franchise, can be both targeted at specific jurisdictions and scaled into sustainable solutions.

        * Citizens can easily share knowledge, experience and experiences with people in their local community.

        ## [We have developed a disruptive business model to create social benefit.](#disruptive)

        Our model for delivering online civic services is cheaper and more efficient than any existing model, but we're not buiding a unicorn. Civically is planned, built and run collaboratively for social benefit.

        * Our organisation and product plans are developed collaboratively with our community.

        * Our code is 100% open source and open to contributions.

        * Our platform is grown and run by its users.

        ## [We believe that the collaborative potential of the internet is undervalued.](#collaborative)

        The technology industry, and the internet itself, would be fundamentally different without open source software, which built for free in a communal fashion. The government and legal sectors will benefit from taking its proven methods of communal value creation seriously.

        * We are building support for true co-production of government and community services.

        * We make it possible for informal experts to be involved in the legal ecosystem.

        * We are developing new ways of compensating both technical and non-technical contributors to civic projects.
