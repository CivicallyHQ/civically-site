      ## [Please Act Respectfully](#respect)

      Please treat Civically, and its users, with respect. Disagreement and debate are encouraged, as long as the discussion is respectful.

      The following behavior is not acceptable and will be sanctioned by moderators:

      * Attacks on any individual or group on the basis of race, gender, disability, religion or other personal or cultural characteristics.

      * Posting of explicit, violent or otherwise disturbing material.

      * Harrasment, impersonation, abuse, or Posting of personal details about an individual without their explicit consent.

      * Spamming or otherwise vandalizing Civically.

      Remember that this is a public forum, and search engines index its pages. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

      <a name="participate"></a>

      ## [Your Participation Counts](#participate)

      The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be &mdash; and avoiding those that do not.

      Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.

      Let’s leave our community better than we found it.

      <a name="flag-problems"></a>

      ## [If You See a Problem, Flag It](#flag-problems)

      Moderators are responsible for Civically, but so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

      When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. _Just flag it_. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.

      In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.

      <a name="keep-tidy"></a>

      ## [Keep It Tidy](#keep-tidy)

      Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

      *   Don’t start a topic in the wrong place.
      *   Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
      *   Don’t post no-content replies.
      *   Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
      *   Don’t sign your posts &mdash; every post has your profile information attached to it.

      Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button.

      <a name="stealing"></a>

      ## [Post Only Your Own Stuff](#stealing)

      You may not post anything that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.

      <a name="power"></a>

      ## [Powered by You](#power)

      Civically is powered by you and your contributions. The Civically Team only plays a curatorial role. The goal is to make Civically 100% community run.

      Join in the discussion about plans for Civically in #plans and pitch in where you can in #work.

      <a name="tos"></a>

      ## [Terms of Service](#tos)

      We have a [Terms of Service](/tos) describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content, privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by our [TOS](/tos).

  plans_welcome:
    title: "About Plans"
    body: |
      Civically has both open source code and an open product. This means that all the details of Civically’s product management are available on Civically itself and can be contributed to by anybody. #plans is where that work happens.

      ### Product management

      ‘Product management’ in technology can refer to a variety of work. The most common aspects are feature development, project management, user experience and analytics. It can also include marketing, research, customer relations, and other business roles. It is typically a role that seeks synthesis between the various disciplines and resources that are part of a successful product.

      Topics in #plans are not strictly limited to 'product management', however it is useful way to think about the role of planning in Civically.

      ### Workflow

      Work starts with users or civically team members making plans or proposals here in #plans. Plans should be as specific as possible and should be largely descriptive. Other users can respond and discuss the plan, and ‘upvote’ the plan to show their support.

      A member of the Civically team will decide what plans will be worked on based on the overall goals of the product, the details of the plan and the support it has received. Once a proposed plan has been selected, it is broken down into task(s) which are posted in #work.

      There are no hard and fast rules as to what plans require their own topic. It is judged on a case by case basis by those creating the topic and by the moderators.

  plugins_welcome:
    title: "About Plugins"
    body: |
      All of the Discourse plugins that combine to create the Civically platform are open source and are open to contributions from anybody. We encourage and welcome pull requests on all plugins. All PRs should comply with the [Civically Development Contribution Policy](/t/development-contribution-policy).

      There is an organisational division between standard plugins, which typically add new features, and ‘extension’ plugins, which typically contain minor changes and/or extend other plugins. This is not a bright-line distinction; some standard plugins may become extensions and some extensions may become plugins. The division is organisational only: both types are, technically speaking, Discourse plugins.

      There is also a division between generalised plugins (‘discourse-’, or ‘x-discourse-’), which can be used on any Discourse instance, and Civically plugins (‘civically-’, or ‘x-civically-’), which are designed specifically for Civically.

      Civically-specific plugins or extensions can be used in another Discourse instance if you know what you’re doing, but they are not currently designed that way. If you do adapt a Civically plugin or extension for your own purposes, we kindly ask that you do so by generalising the functionality so that others may also use it.

      It is useful to think of Civically’s plugins as being divided into three groups: Discourse plugins, Civically plugins and Extensions.

      ### Discourse Plugins

      These plugins can be used on any instance of Discourse right now, and most are already used on a variety of different Discourse instances. Each of these has an existing topic on meta.discourse.org, which is (and will remain) the canonical place for discussion about the plugin:

      * [Custom Layouts](https://meta.discourse.org/t/custom-layouts-plugin/55208)
      * [Ratings](https://meta.discourse.org/t/topic-ratings-plugin/39578)
      * [Locations](https://meta.discourse.org/t/locations-plugin/69742)
      * [Events](https://meta.discourse.org/t/events-plugin-calendar/69776)
      * [Elections](https://meta.discourse.org/t/elections-plugin/68521)
      * [Topic List Previews](https://meta.discourse.org/t/topic-list-previews/41630)
      * [Custom Wizard](https://meta.discourse.org/t/custom-wizard-plugin/73345)
      * [Category Moderator Lite](https://meta.discourse.org/t/category-moderator-lite/67305)
      * [Solved](https://meta.discourse.org/c/plugin/solved)
      * [Voting](https://meta.discourse.org/c/plugin/voting)

      ### Civically Plugins

      The goal is to generalise the functionality of these plugins and make the Civically-specific aspects settings, translation files or isolated in a Civically-specific extension. PRs that further that goal are particularly welcome. The current place to discuss these plugins is the relevant plugin topic here on Civically:

      * [Civically App](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-app)
      * [Civically Site](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-site)
      * [Civically Place](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-place)
      * [Civically Petition](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-petition)
      * [Civically Menus](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-menus)
      * [Civically Layout](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-navigation)
      * [Civically User](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-user)
      * [Civically Composer Addons](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-composer-addons)
      * [Civically Landing Page](https://github.com/civicallyhq/civically-landing-page)

      ### Extensions

      Some of these extend other plugins and some extend core Discourse functionality. Most are specific to Civically (i.e. ‘x-civically-’) and are likely to remain so, although we will keep looking for opportunities to generalise the functionality where possible:

      * [Discourse Poll Extension](https://github.com/angusmcleod/x-discourse-poll)
      * [Civically Poll Extension](https://github.com/civicallyhq/x-civically-poll)
      * [Civically Voting Extension](https://github.com/civicallyhq/x-civically-voting)
      * [Civically Solved Extension](https://github.com/civicallyhq/x-civically-solved)
      * [Civically Search Extension](https://github.com/civicallyhq/x-civically-search)
      * [Civically Topic Extension](https://github.com/civicallyhq/x-civically-topic)
      * [Civically Group Extension](https://github.com/civicallyhq/x-civically-group)

    body: |
      #work is where work on Civically is done. Work can be development, design, or anything else for which there are defined, discrete tasks.

      There are no hard rules as to what tasks require their own topic. It is judged on a case by case basis by those working on the task and by the moderators.

      Generally speaking work should relate to plan(s) in the #plans, however this will not be true in all cases.
